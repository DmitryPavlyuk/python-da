       "    'description': 'Advanced Data Science and Analytics with Python enables data scientists to continue developing their skills and apply them in business as well as academic settings. The subjects discussed in this book are complementary and a follow-up to the topics discussed in Data Science and Analytics with Python. The aim is to cover important advanced areas in data science using tools developed in Python such as SciKit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Beautiful Soup, NLTK, NetworkX and others. The model development is supported by the use of frameworks such as Keras, TensorFlow and Core ML, as well as Swift for the development of iOS and MacOS applications. Features: Targets readers with a background in programming, who are interested in the tools used in data analytics and data science Uses Python throughout Presents tools, alongside solved examples, with steps that the reader can easily reproduce and adapt to their needs Focuses on the practical use of the tools rather than on lengthy explanations Provides the reader with the opportunity to use the book whenever needed rather than following a sequential path The book can be read independently from the previous volume and each of the chapters in this volume is sufficiently independent from the others, providing flexibility for the reader. Each of the topics addressed in the book tackles the data science workflow from a practical perspective, concentrating on the process and results obtained. The implementation and deployment of trained models are central to the book. Time series analysis, natural language processing, topic modelling, social network analysis, neural networks and deep learning are comprehensively covered. The book discusses the need to develop data products and addresses the subject of bringing models to their intended audiences – in this case, literally to the users’ fingertips in the form of an iPhone app. About the Author Dr. Jesús Rogel-Salazar is a lead data scientist in the field, working for companies such as Tympa Health Technologies, Barclays, AKQA, IBM Data Science Studio and Dow Jones. He is a visiting researcher at the Department of Physics at Imperial College London, UK and a member of the School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics at the University of Hertfordshire, UK.',\n",

       "    'description': 'The Hands-On, Example-Rich Introduction to Pandas Data Analysis in Python Today, analysts must manage data characterized by extraordinary variety, velocity, and volume. Using the open source Pandas library, you can use Python to rapidly automate and perform virtually any data analysis task, no matter how large or complex. Pandas can help you ensure the veracity of your data, visualize it for effective decision-making, and reliably reproduce analyses across multiple datasets. Pandas for Everyone brings together practical knowledge and insight for solving real problems with Pandas, even if you’re new to Python data analysis. Daniel Y. Chen introduces key concepts through simple but practical examples, incrementally building on them to solve more difficult, real-world problems. Chen gives you a jumpstart on using Pandas with a realistic dataset and covers combining datasets, handling missing data, and structuring datasets for easier analysis and visualization. He demonstrates powerful data cleaning techniques, from basic string manipulation to applying functions simultaneously across dataframes. Once your data is ready, Chen guides you through fitting models for prediction, clustering, inference, and exploration. He provides tips on performance and scalability, and introduces you to the wider Python data analysis ecosystem. Work with DataFrames and Series, and import or export data Create plots with matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas Combine datasets and handle missing data Reshape, tidy, and clean datasets so they’re easier to work with Convert data types and manipulate text strings Apply functions to scale data manipulations Aggregate, transform, and filter large datasets with groupby Leverage Pandas’ advanced date and time capabilities Fit linear models using statsmodels and scikit-learn libraries Use generalized linear modeling to fit models with different response variables Compare multiple models to select the “best” Regularize to overcome overfitting and improve performance Use clustering in unsupervised machine learning',\n",

       "    'description': 'Python Data Analytics will help you tackle the world of data acquisition and analysis using the power of the Python language. At the heart of this book lies the coverage of pandas, an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. Author Fabio Nelli expertly shows the strength of the Python programming language when applied to processing, managing and retrieving information. Inside, you will see how intuitive and flexible it is to discover and communicate meaningful patterns of data using Python scripts, reporting systems, and data export. This book examines how to go about obtaining, processing, storing, managing and analyzing data using the Python programming language. You will use Python and other open source tools to wrangle data and tease out interesting and important trends in that data that will allow you to predict future patterns. Whether you are dealing with sales data, investment data (stocks, bonds, etc.), medical data, web page usage, or any other type of data set, Python can be used to interpret, analyze, and glean information from a pile of numbers and statistics. This book is an invaluable reference with its examples of storing and accessing data in a database; it walks you through the process of report generation; it provides three real world case studies or examples that you can take with you for your everyday analysis needs.',\n",

Every field of study and area of business has been affected as people increasingly realize the value of the incredible quantities of data being generated. But to extract value from those data, one needs to be trained in the proper data science skills. The R programming language has become the de facto programming language for data science. Its flexibility, power, sophistication, and expressiveness have made it an invaluable tool for data scientists around the world. This book is about the fundamentals of R programming.Finally, you'll learn some down-to-earth practical skills that will help you overcome the common challenges that frequently derail data science projects Reproducibility is the idea that data analyses should be published or made available with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them. The need for reproducible report writing is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available.\",\n",

Data analytics has become part and parcel in the contemporary technologically fast paced world. We have amazing tools and software that allow us to analyse data available in various formats. However, most of the popular paid software and packages for data analysis is not affordable or not even accessible for the students, researchers. This is true in the case of many NGOs and agencies how are involved in community based research in developing countries. We have popular open source platforms and tools such as R and Python for data analysis. This book makes use of Python because of its simplicity, adaptability, broader scope and greater potential in advanced data mining and text mining contexts. We found it as a need to educate and train the researchers from social science and marketing research background, so that they could make use of Python, a promising tool to meet simple to extremely complex data analyses needs free of cost. The learnings from this book will not only help them in doing their conventional data analyses but also enable them to pursue advanced knowledge in machine learning algorithms, text analytics and other new generation techniques with the support of freely accessible open source platforms. Since the objective of the book is to educate the researchers with no programming background, we have made every effort to give hands-on experience in learning some basic coding in Python, which is sufficient for the readers to follow the book. The step-by-step procedure to do various data processing and analysis described in this book will make it easy for the users. Apart from that, we have tried our level best to give explanations on specific codes and how they perform to get us the desired output. We also request you to give you valuable comments and suggestions on the book, via our blog, so that we could improve the same in the upcoming volumes. We commit ourselves to providing explanations to the readers' questions related to the codes and analysis provided in this book. The book specifically deals with data sets of row and column format, as the general format commonly used in social science research, which most of the researchers are familiar with. So we do not work with arrays and dictionaries, except in one or two occasions (only to make you familiar with that) instead prefer to make use of Excel data and pandas data frame. The book consists of thirteen chapters. The first chapter gives an introduction to Python and its relevance and scope in contemporary data analysis contexts. Ch. 2 teaches the basics and Python coding, Ch. 3-7, provide a step-by-step narration of how to enter data, process it, preliminary analysis and data cleaning with the help of Python, Ch.8-9, present data visualizations and narration techniques using Python; Ch.10.demonstrate how Python can use for statistical analysis. The remaining chapters are focusing on giving more real life situations in data analysis and the practical solutions to handle them. The exercises provided in the book are similar to real analysis situations, and that will help the reader for an easy transition to the data analyst jobs. The authors have taken utmost care identifying and providing solutions to all practical difficulties the readers may face while using Python for data analysis purpose. The authors have developed a series of codes and have incorporated them to make data processing and analysis convenient and easy for the researchers. The self-learning materials given in this book will help social science and marketing researchers to deepen their understanding of various steps in data processing and analyses and to gain advanced skills in using Python for this purpose.\",\n",

Instead of deployment, operations, or software development usually associated with distributed computing, you’ll focus on particular analyses you can build, the data warehousing techniques that Hadoop provides, and higher order data workflows this framework can produce. Data scientists and analysts will learn how to perform a wide range of techniques, from writing MapReduce and Spark applications with Python to using advanced modeling and data management with Spark MLlib, Hive, and HBase. You’ll also learn about the analytical processes and data systems available to build and empower data products that can handle—and actually require—huge amounts of data. Understand core concepts behind Hadoop and cluster computing Use design patterns and parallel analytical algorithms to create distributed data analysis jobs Learn about data management, mining, and warehousing in a distributed context using Apache Hive and HBase Use Sqoop and Apache Flume to ingest data from relational databases Program complex Hadoop and Spark applications with Apache Pig and Spark DataFrames Perform machine learning techniques such as classification, clustering, and collaborative filtering with Spark’s MLlib',\n",
