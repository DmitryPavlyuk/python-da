    "Data analytics project is a showcase of your skills on data processing using Python. Main stages of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Selection of your research data set__\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection can be based on your profesional activities (preferred), personal side projects, hobbies, or just pure curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Organising a Jupiter notebook that will be used for all operations and the project report__\n",
    "\n",
    "For brevity reasons, the report is limited by 2000 words (excl. source codes)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Data collection__\n",
    "\n",
    "This is preferable to organise data collection from the notebook - e.g., downloading of data from open sources. If the data set are not public or not available for automatic collection, then this is allowed to use local files for loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Business understanding__\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe potential applications of the data set - how and for which purposes it can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Loading the data set__\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set can be heterogeneous and include numeric data, text fragments, images, etc. This is highly recommended to use NumPy, Pandas and/or pure Python data structures to highlight your skills on these libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Data understanding / visualisation__\n",
    "\n",
    "This is recommended to use Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualising your data set. Note that your plots should tell the story - supplement them with interesting conclusions/insights\n",
    "\n",
    "7. __Data preparation__\n",
    "\n",
    "Data clean up, transformation, indexing, aggreagation, etc. - everything you need for further stages\n",
    "\n",
    "8. __Data modelling (optional)__\n",
    "\n",
    "Illustrate solution of one of the stated business problems using the loaded data set. The possible solution require modelling, which will be mainly covered by next study courses, so this is optional at the moment.\n"
